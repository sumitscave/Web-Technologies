    <h1>Aloo Paratha Recipe</h1>
    <p>
      If you’re a fan of bread and potatoes, you’re going to love this Punjabi
      Aloo Paratha or Aloo ka Paratha. Sometimes spelled Alu Paratha, this
      potato stuffed flatbread is a popular Indian breakfast that combines two
      of my favorite starches in a single delectable package. Crisp on the
      outside and tender on the inside, this humble meal is as comforting as a
      hug. What’s not to love?
